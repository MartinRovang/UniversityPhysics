    Summary:
        When called creates a hawk/hoik object. Inherits from Boid class

    Args:
    x: x-position

    y: y-position 

    __init__:\n

    flock: list

    self.radius = HAWK_RADIUS_START_VALUE  | See config

    Methods:
    move(): Places the moving object according to its speed and magnitude.

    find_flock(boids): assigns boids to a boids flock.

    rule1(): Activates first rule of the boid, moves the boid to percieved center of local flockmates.

    rule2(): Activates second rule of the boid, makes the boid avoid eachother when they get to close.

    rule3(): Activates third rule of the boid, boid wants to match velocity the boids in their vicinity.

    attack(boids): Finds the closest boid and tries to eat it.

    draw: Draws the  object on the screen.

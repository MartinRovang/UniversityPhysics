    Summary:
        Inherits from MovingObject, this class makes the boids object
        
    Args:
    x: x-position.

    y: y-position.   

    Methods:
    move(TIME_PASSED_SECONDS): Places the moving object according to its speed and magnitude.

    get_pos: Returns the position (x, y).

    set_pos(x,y): Sets the position to (x, y).

    set_vel(velx,vely): Sets the velocity to (velx, vely).

    get_vel: Returns the velocity (velx, vely).

    crash_wall_check(TIME_PASSED_SECONDS, wall_lock): Checks if the object is colliding with the walls of the screen, and bounce them off if wall_lock == 1 else they go to the other side.

    noisy_movement(TIME_PASSED_SECONDS): Makes the noisy movement to the hawks.

    flocking(hawks): Takes the list of hawks and makes the hawks flock together to their percieved center.

    match_speed(hawks): Takes the list of hawks and sets the avarage heading of the flock.

    avoid_crash(hawks): Takes the list of hawks and makes them avoid eachother.

    attack(boids): Takes the list of boids and sends the hawk to attack the nearest boid.

    draw: draws the obstacle object on the screen
